# Route Finder Algorithm

Small project for a route algorithm made with typescript, node, and jest. The project also uses ESLint to keep a clean and readable code.
## Examples

Given an array of arrays containing the user's next location based on its current location, the algorithm must return to the user the entire route in one single array.

```javascript
// given the following input
findRoutes([
  ["GRU", "SSA"],
  ["GIG", "POA"],
  ["SSA", "GIG"],
  ["POA", "FOR"],
]);

// it must return the following output: ["GRU, SSA, GIG, POA, FOR"]
```
